HOW TO GENERATE EXERCISES

The exercise writing tool (write_exercise.py3) allows users to produce exercises for HarmonyLab with ease. This tool produces the .json files that HarmonyLab reads.

Instead of working through the prompts, users may prepare text files run the command `python3 write_exercise.py3 input.txt`.

LIMITATIONS

The supported pitch classes are the 21 naturals, sharps, and flats, and B-double-flat, F-double-sharp, C-double-sharp, and G-double-sharp (for input); and all 30 major and minor keys are supported (for both input and output).
